Description: The 'ploidyverse' is a group of R packages for the analysis of genetic data
  from diploid, polyploid, and mixed-ploidy samples using standardized input and output 
  formats. The 'ploidyverseClasses' package defines S4 classes extending the 
  collapsedVcf class from 'VariantAnnotation', in order to facilitate import and
  export of data among 'ploidyverse' packages and between the 'ploidyverse' and other
  software.  A file format specification is also included, describing requirements and
  general advice for VCF files in the 'ploidyverse'.
