Description: The 'ploidyverse' is a group of R packages for the analysis of
  genetic data from diploid, polyploid, and mixed-ploidy samples using 
  standardized input and output formats. The 'ploidyverseClasses' package 
  extends the Vcf class from 'VariantAnnotation' and provides utilities to 
  facilitate import and export of data among 'ploidyverse' packages and between
  the 'ploidyverse' and other software.  A file format specification is also 
  included, describing requirements and general advice for VCF files in the
  'ploidyverse'.
