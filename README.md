# ploidyverseClasses
This R package extends the `VCF` S4 class from Bioconductor's 
[VariantAnnotation](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/VariantAnnotation.html)
package, with new methods to facilitate import and export of VCF data using
ploidyverse software.

A draft specification for VCF within the ploidyverse can be found at
[inst/doc/ploidyverse_VCF_specification.md](https://github.com/ploidyverse/ploidyverseClasses/blob/master/inst/doc/ploidyverse_VCF_specification.md).
